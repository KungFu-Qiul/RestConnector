# RestConnector
RestConnector is a test framework for RESTful HTTP and JAVA APIs. It is derived from the practical needs of daily testing work. The design philosophy of RestConnector is inspired and influenced by [spring-test-mvc](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-mvc) and [resteasy-client](https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy).

RestConnector can conveniently accomplish the testing process for RESTful HTTP servers with additional functionality of testing configuration.
